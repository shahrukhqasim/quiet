# quiet
Quiet command for Linux for stopping commands and programs for dumping everything on the terminal

Very often when you run some program on Linux, you end up receiving command line dump which causes hindrance in your workflow.

q (or quiet) is to eradicate this issue.

Just type the command and put q in front of it with a space; for example:

q gparted
(and hit enter)

And there you are! Clean terminal with no junk you are not interested in.
